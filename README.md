Planning the concept of the game and the tutorials I could make that would be useful in the future projects.

I figured I wanted to make a game similiar to Pong game, since it contains all the fundamental scripts to make any game. To make this game more interesting, I made it a 3D project. This will later enable me to play with the theme, animations and shaders later on. I have made a script for the player and ball movement. No errors occured, a solid start.

I have tried to make a code for the Cube moved by the computer. I want the other player to follow the ball on the x axis (move left and right). The code did not want to work at first, since I have mixed up the axis and written the computer to move on z axis instead. Since I have already made the code for the player, ball movement, and AI movement. The next step is to write the tutorials on this and start writing the code for the restart of the game. I want the game to restart when the ball exits the platform.
