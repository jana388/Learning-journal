Planning the concept of the game and the tutorials I could make that would be useful in the future projects.

I figured I wanted to make a game similiar to Pong game, since it contains all the fundamental scripts to make any game. To make this game more interesting, I made it a 3D project. This will later enable me to play with the theme, animations and shaders later on. I have made a script for the player and ball movement. No errors occured, a solid start.
