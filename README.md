Today I created a learning journal.

Planning the concept of the game and the tutorials I could make that would be useful in the future projects.

I figured I wanted to make a game similiar to Pong game, since it contains all the fundamental scripts to make any game. To make this game more interesting, I made it a 3D project. This will later enable me to play with the theme, animations and shaders later on. I have made a script for the player and ball movement. No errors occured, a solid start.

I have tried to make a code for the Cube moved by the computer. I want the other player to follow the ball on the x axis (move left and right). The code did not want to work at first, since I have mixed up the axis and written the computer to move on z axis instead. After figuring this out, the code went smoothly. Since I have already made the code for the player, ball , and AI movement, the next step is to write the tutorials on this and start writing the code for the restart of the game. I want the game to restart when the ball exits the platform.

Today I am going to work on the Game Controller, so the program knows when the ball reaches the goal and restarts the game.
